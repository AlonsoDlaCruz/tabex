        <h4>In 1598, King Philip II named the city &quot;Villa Hermosa of San Juan Bautista,&quot; and granted it use of a royal 
            shield on its coat of arms which is still in use today. In the city's long history, its name changed many 
            times. In 1916, governor Francisco J. Mújica decreed to eliminate the name of &quot;San Juan Bautista,&quot; leaving 
            only &quot;Villahermosa.&quot;</h4>

        People from tabasco are born fish eaters, specially the ones who lives in sweet water, like pejelagarto, crappie, lisa, 
        pámpano and bass. That's why we have a lot of typical foods based on these fish. My favorite one is 
        <a href="https://recetariofacilitadorescid.blogspot.com/2019/05/pejelagarto-asado.html" target="_blank">
            grilled pejelagarto,</a> its flavor is different than any other fish. However, many people says that it's flavor 
            is like dogfish, I would say that they both have different essence and similar consistence.
